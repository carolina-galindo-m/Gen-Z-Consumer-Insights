# 🧠 Gen Z Consumer Insights — Korn Ferry Challenge

This repository showcases a **primary research** project my team and I conducted for the **Korn Ferry Consulting Challenge**, focused on understanding **Gen Z** attitudes, behaviors, and brand perceptions, and translating those findings into **actionable strategy**. Our work was **selected as a finalist** and presented to judges/executives at Korn Ferry.  

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Objective:** Identify what drives Gen Z awareness, consideration, and preference within a target category, then convert those insights into clear **positioning, messaging, and go‑to‑market recommendations**.  
- **Deliverable:** A strategy presentation built entirely on **original survey data** we designed, fielded, and analyzed. All charts/visuals in the slide deck derive from our team’s dataset.

> **Why this matters:** This work mirrors the day‑to‑day of **Marketing/Consumer Insights** roles—designing research, analyzing data, and turning insights into decisions for marketing, brand, and product teams.

## 🔬 Research Questions

1. Which **values, motivations, and barriers** shape Gen Z perceptions and buying behavior in this category?  
2. What **attributes, messages, and proof points** move Gen Z from awareness to trial/preference?  
3. How do perceptions and priorities **vary by sub‑segments** (e.g., usage frequency, lifestyle cohorts)?  
4. Where are the **whitespace opportunities** and **competitive risks** that inform strategy?

## 🧪 Methodology

- **Approach:** Mixed‑methods **survey research** (closed + open‑ended items) developed by our team; descriptive analytics and insight synthesis.  
- **Population:** **Gen Z university students** (ages [14–29]) recruited on campus via [email/social/class channels].  
- **Fieldwork window:** [03/26/2025 – 04/11/2025].  
- **Sample size:** **N = [172]** valid responses after cleaning.  
- **Measures:** Demographics; category usage; attitudes/values; brand perceptions; purchase drivers; media & content habits.  
- **Analysis:** Descriptive statistics (freq/means), cross‑tabs on key segments, thematic coding of open‑ends, and prioritization of insight themes.  
- **Tools:** [Google forms/Excel]; slide creation in [Canva].  
- **Data provenance:** All charts and visuals in the deck were produced from **our primary dataset**.

> **Ethics:** Participation was voluntary and anonymous; results reported in aggregate.

## 📊 Dataset Snapshot

- **N:** [172] respondents  
- **Age:** [14–29, median 21]  
- **Gender split:** [58% women, 42% men]  
- **Top discovery channels:** [Instagram, friends/UGC]  
- **Top decision drivers:** [value-for-money, authenticity, sustainability]  

---

## 🔎 Key Insights

- **Value + Authenticity drive trust.** Gen Z favors brands with clear value and transparent purpose; highly polished corporate language tends to underperform.  
- **UGC outperforms brand‑led creative** for discovery. Peer content and short‑form video correlate with higher trial intent vs. traditional ads.  
- **Segment differences are material.** Light vs. heavy users show distinct attribute priorities (e.g., convenience/price vs. features/performance), supporting **differentiated messaging**.  
- **Friction points cluster near conversion.** Proof points (reviews, side‑by‑sides, price clarity) meaningfully reduce hesitation and increase likelihood to try.
